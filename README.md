# RemoteDev

RemoteDev is a job listing platform designed for developers searching for remote work.

Users can search for job listings, which are displayed in chronological order, and bookmark job posts for later reference.

Built with Vanilla JavaScript, this project focuses on search functionality, state management, and UI design, making job searching more efficient.

The project was created as a part of online course.
